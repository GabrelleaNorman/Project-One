UNC First Project
# Introduction
For this project we will be analyzing NBA Players of the Week data from 1978-2020.
Our goal of the project was to analyze the winningest player and franchise, see which draft classes produced the most NBA Player of the Week award winners, the level of experience each player had, and the average height of winners over each season.
