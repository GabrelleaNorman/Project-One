# Project-One
UNC First Project

# Introduction
For this project we will be analyzing NBA Players of the Week data from 1978-2020.
Our goal of the project was to analyze the winningest player and franchise, see which draft classes produced the most NBA Player of the Week award winners, the level of experience each player had, and the average height of winners over each season.

# Grabbing the Data
To start, load in the NBA player of the week dataset from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacobbaruch/nba-player-of-the-week?resource=download

# Cleaning the Data
Throughout the history of the NBA, many teams have relocated or changed their team name. In order to tell the complete story adjust the names of each team that has gone through a change over the years so that all 30 NBA teams had their correct data history. In the NBA there are guards, forwards, and centers, but the dataset indicates 11 unique positions. These positions need to be grouped and cleaned so the data only uses guards, forwards, and centers.

# Installation:
Install Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib on your computer
Write in the following libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
Download the “Project 1” file from Github onto your computer
Ensure that the “Project 1” file contains:
.gitignore
NBA Analytics.ipynb
NBA_player_of_the_week.csv
README.csv
Open NBA Analytics.ipynb using VScode or Jupyter Notebooks

# Usage:
This file analyzes the data located in NBA_Player_of_the_Week.csv.

Ensure that NBA_Player_of_the_Week.csv is located in the same folder as NBA Analytics.ipynb.  If it is not, please update the file path or place the files in the same folder.
Run the code in order
If you would like to only see data from a specific chart, first run the cleaning data.  Your chart may also depend on variables established in previous lines of coding.  Ensure that you run the lines defining all modules present in the chart to avoid errors.
